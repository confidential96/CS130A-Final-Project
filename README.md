# CS130A-Final-Project
The final project in my first course in algorithm analysis

This project created a simple sort of social network. To hold the names we initially stored friends with a Hash Table with insert/delete/find and etc(This supported Linear Probing and Double Hashing). The important part about this was that we implemented a B-Tree to sort the "friends" in lexicographic order. This included insert/delete/find and etc.
